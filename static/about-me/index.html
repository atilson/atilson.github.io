Honestly, I'm currently more comfortable simply referring to myself as an Intuitive Empath.</p>
<p>If you have the time and curiousity, read my opening post <a href="../my-discovery/">My Discovery</a> to learn more about how my journey unfolded.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I have endured rare premonition dreams, unexplanable signs of prediction, and the ability to mold into the emotions of those I was surrounded by. I never thought this to be more than my own experienced character though, and naturally saw myself fall into the personality of someone who wanted to help others because I felt what it was like.</p>
<p>After recognizing and researching who I am, I started to slowly notice everything I pick up on (what emotions came from who, what thoughts I received while observing and conversing with someone). Before this point, these "perceptions" mostly turned into me having conflicted thoughts, unexplained mood shifts, and health issues.</p>
<p>After over a year on this journey, I wanted to share some of my experience in a blog in hope that someone will find some comfort, guidance, understanding, insight or even just enjoy as a curious read. After time spent working on myself, I felt an urge to write and subsequently came up with a list of ideas to base articles on.</p>
<p>I welcome contact by <a href="mailto:empathconfessions@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
<p>I welcome and thank all for stopping by! Remember that I publish a new article every Tuesday!</p>
<p>Namaste!</p>
