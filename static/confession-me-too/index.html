            <section class="post-full-content">
                <div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>I <strong>never</strong> would've imagined I would say I am a victim of sexual abuse; let alone speak out about it in any way... So this is a very bold move for me even in the comfort of anonymity. Although it all happened over 15 years ago, the memories still surface every once in awhile. One significant event serves as a <em>very</em> detailed memory that continues to feel like it happened last year. It's hard enough to speak up about it due to the chaos that follows, but I find it even harder to move on from once coming to terms with it. My consolation has been in seeing the truth and how it doesn't have to dictate who I am anymore. And for that much, I want the truth to at least be written somewhere.</p>
<p>My experiences happened while I was young - most of it before I was in high school. Much like how my therapist diagnosed the abuse and counseled me behind closed doors, the abuse occurred out of sight of others (but sometimes, among those that didn't care otherwise). These facts alone are exactly why I'm terrified to speak, much less point a finger and press charges... because I know it would be my word against everyone that would oppose the statement. Having been asked if I would take action on it, I froze - the anxiety of facing that 2 decades later and having to purposely revisit the experience is not something I want to do. In fact, I recall stating that "I don't think I can be in the same room as.." that person; it would be unbearable and feels threatening to just think of. If anyone wants to know why this information stays as a secret for so long, I would say it's because of the aftermath.</p>
<p>In addition to facing the reality of the situation itself, I found it to be heartbreaking work to move on from it. Because I was so young when these experiences happened, it was then painted as a "normal" picture for me. Not only was I not able to do anything differently about the situation, but I realize I grew up having a certain (truth: unhealthy) expectation because of it. <strong>This</strong> is exactly why I never saw any of that behaviour as being abusive, and is also why I carried the guilt of feeling like I allowed myself to be molested. As this was regurgitated when I started going through my life changes in my late 20's, it was a shocking slap in the face to be told what it <em>really</em> was. It also shattered my reality to think that I've spent 25+ years of my life living with an imposed and dysfunctional mentality. Just as if it suddenly came up as a repressed memory, I'm left asking: <strong>Who am I after all this, and why did this happen to me?</strong></p>
<p>Truth be told, no one ever batted an eye or questioned this particular person as there didn't seem to be any reason to. The behaviour that occurred in the presence of others came out as "jokes", but even still: no one ever stopped to protect or defend me as a child/person. I have a feeling that because of enduring this, I became that kid at school that was "okay" with being the weird girl that everyone picked on and gossiped about. It was beyond rough, but seeing it as "normal", I felt there was no escaping any of it. So I accepted it as this is how life <em>really</em> is.</p>
<p>As I'm sure a lot of people can remember significant events from their early years, I remember the big events in addition to the moments that disturbed my young mind. As the latter obviously burns deeper into the brain, it's recognizing my memories that made me wonder what else I may have overlooked. Knowing I may have possibly repressed revealing memories frightened me so much that I went searching for them... What I recalled scared me enough to stop there: I remembered that certain attention died down after I went through puberty, and I ended up recalling what seemed to be a final conversation involving drawing a line (now that I'm developing into a woman). I've debated seeing a hypnotist since remembering this much, but am not sure if it matters anymore - the damage is done either way. Regardless, there's one memory that my brain is able to replay as if a memorized movie..</p>
<p>When I was molested, I was stunned and powerless. At this point I would think it's obvious that my abuser was an adult; I will confirm that much. What was supposed to be me taking a nap turned into the most violating, and one of the most memorable, experiences of my life. My attempts of pushing away the hand suddenly rubbing my privates went nowhere, and I eventually accepted that I couldn't physically stop it as it persisted. Feeling there was nothing else I could do, I remember going numb and staring at the wall... waiting for it to be over. Because this was all my preteen self could do in the situation, I felt like I reciprocated and <em>therefore</em> felt guilty for it happening. I even remember thinking to myself (while considering my options during): "If I scream.. no one will believe me".<br>
<strong>I honestly thought I was going to carry this secret to my grave.</strong></p>
<p>I never thought the details were important, but they ended up being the catalyst for my revelation. In addition to the physical factor involved, I was further bothered that the event occurred in a very particular situation. There's absolutely <strong>no</strong> excuses for anything that happens like this though.. but I'm referring to deniable situations such as "I didn't realize it was you" or "i was drunk". Yes, this applied to the abuser's side of this story, which was another reason it never came up. I buried this deep, reminded occasionally by my guilt from it, but generally ignored it otherwise. I honestly never thought much of this event again until a couple years before my revelations; when I ran into and caught up with someone from my childhood. In one candid conversation, this person claimed they were molested by my abuser - in the exact same situation that mine occurred. At that time, I defended my abuser in my brainwashed state... in fact, I kept my experience a secret from this person too. But the details from that story planted a seed of doubt in me that sent me to therapy.</p>
<p>I thought it had to be a freaky coincidence, but let's be honest: it makes me angry to step back and look at every detail from the outside now. Now that I'm clear of my clouded thinking and have matured as a person, I cannot see there's any excuses for anything that happened. It took me a long time to forgive myself for it happening to me, and just as long to reconcile all the relationships that were either toxic or negatively effected because of it. I never realized that my own sexuality was repressed as a result of everything I've experienced, and such have struggled to be comfortable with my own body until more recently. For the longest time I found it to be normal to feel some sense of shame with anything related to sex, and carried a negative self-image as a result of the commentary, gestures, and uninvited touches I endured. I realize now I made some bad choices as my way to "rebel" and attempt to overwrite the bad thoughts and memories.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I never truly felt like I owned my whole body once it was first violated... but I never realized that for what it was and why as I was still young. What makes matters worse is that now that I've come as far as I have, I can honestly say some of the heartbreaking truths about my silence in those early years: I knew (for example:) screaming and getting attention would only serve to cause a scene in which I would be called crazy, and then I would never hear the end of that accusation. Deep down, my innocent young self somehow knew that speaking up on the things that happened to me would only have made things worse. Without divulging much further than saying it's based on my experience and knowledge of the people involved, I know deep down that the only response I would've received is an excuse in denial of the real problem. Again, I just see a full circle of nothing good coming from having spoken up.</p>
<p>Despite <strong>everything</strong>, I have been able to move on with life, appearing as if it hadn't happened to me. I won't lie in that there are still PTSD triggers left to deal with (if there's anything that triggers a memory or thought of, or someone with similar personality traits or behaviour), and life needs to stop for a minute or two to get back into the right frame of mind. While it may have changed me in a way that set me back in some aspects of life, the survival experience from it all adds to my personality in such a way that I can't converse with or relate to most people. It makes me sad when everyday interactions remind me of everything I've missed (or are behind on) due to what I've been through, but I hold hope that I'll get where I want to be in the future. Sometimes, we (as survivors) have to try to remember how amazing we are to still be around and kicking after all we've been through.</p>
